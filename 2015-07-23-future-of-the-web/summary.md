h3. Future of the Web

*Audience:*
Web Developers familiar with MVC frameworks and ES4/5

*Summary:*

The web is rapidly changing and evolving. Tech keeps coming to make our jobs “easy." This web thing, it shouldn’t be hard. Right? Well..

Two years ago MVC/MVVM blew up; HTML5 and ES5 have gone mainstream with the help of polyfills; Web modules have become the new standard for loading files; And recently new concepts such as shadow dom / web components have taken center stage.

It’s a lot to take in, and just as you start to master these concepts new ones appear on the horizon: asm, web assembly, ES6, TypeScript, etc.

It’s daunting to work in a domain where something you spent last year working on is proclaimed dead. The death of javascript? The death of MVC? Hyperbole much?

But things are changing. And as developers, we need to learn to look ahead and adapt. So let’s look at what’s coming. The giants (Microsoft and Google) have partnered on some really cool tech, and some really big names have got behind them. Let’s look down the road at what’s in development. Talk about the problem the are trying to solve. And most importantly discuss how to find harmony as a developer in the chaos and churn.
